= Mercurial Plugin for Trac (#1847) =

There is an experimental plugin for Trac [milestone:0.9] which enables
[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial Mercurial] to be used 
instead of [http://subversion.tigris.org Subversion]
for the VersioningSystemBackend.


== Download and Installation ==

==== Trac ====
The plugin needs a slightly modified version of Trac 0.9, 
which offers support for pluggable SCM backends.
This version can be found in source:sandbox/vc-refactoring

Simply do:
{{{
svn co http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/trac/sandbox/vc-refactoring trac-for-hg
}}}
and install from there (`cd trac-for-hg; python setup.py install`).


The plugin itself is available from source:sandbox/mercurial-plugin

Check it out, too:
{{{
svn co http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/sandbox/mercurial-plugin .
}}}
and create an "egg" from there (`cd hg-plugin; python setup.py bdist_egg`).
Note that you'll need
[http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools setuptools] 
>= 0.6 for that (I used setuptools-0.6a5).

===== Releases =====
|| '''Version''' || mercurial-plugin || Trac vc-refactoring ||
||      0.1      ||       r2482      ||        r2479        ||


==== Mercurial ====
The plugin has been tested with Mercurial 0.7 and a few later versions
(upto Changeset 1481:acd1832ebf31 from http://selenic.com/hg).
It won't work with earlier versions.
You can download hg from 
[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Download Hg:Download].


== Configuration ==

The plugin egg can be added to the `plugins` folder of an existing environment,
or to a brand new environment. Note that if you create a new environment, it's
currently necessary to ''not'' specify the repository directory during the
`initenv` step (''this will probably be fixed soon'').

In either case, you'll need to specify the backend scheme to be used
(here `hg:`) in front of the actual repository location, in TracIni:
{{{
[trac]
repository_dir = hg:/path/to/my/hg/repository
}}}

Also, you'll need to explicitely disable the SVN components:
{{{
[components]
trac.versioncontrol.svn_fs.* = disabled
}}}

''Note: that constraint will most certainly be lifted in the future''


== Features ==

The Mercurial support is pretty basic, but works well. I've tested that 
on the Mercurial repository itself and the performance is quite good, 
even if there's currently ''no'' caching in the database
(I'm still not decided if that's a feature or a bug).

For those used to Subversion in general and Subversion repository browsing
in Trac in particular, there are a few differences worth noting.

=== Mercurial Changesets ===

==== Changeset Navigation ====

In Mercurial, the ''Previous Changeset''/''Next Changeset'' navigation is 
''not'' purely sequential, as it is in Subversion.
Instead of a ''flat'' history of successive changesets, we actually navigate
a DAG of changesets. 
This means a changeset can have multiple parents (0, 1 or 2) and multiple
children as well (0 to n). 

Therefore, ''Previous Changeset'' is a link to the first parent, 
and ''Next Changeset'' is a link to the first children.
In case there are additional parents or children, these are shown as 
additional changeset properties (''Parents'' or ''Children''), 
placed below the ''Author'' property and above the ''Message'' property.

[[Image(hg-plugin-changeset.png)]]

Another additional changeset property is the list of ''Tags'' that
might be associated with a changeset.

==== Wiki syntax ====

The Wiki syntax has been extended a bit, to cope with the hexadecimal
notation of hg changesets. E.g `[8ef2]` would link to the changeset 
8ef2ba892518c115170398ec754bd1c27cab271f ...
Also, it is possible to refer to changesets using the changeset: prefix 
(or cset: or chgset:, for hgweb compatibility). 
The tag: prefix can be used to refer to symbolic tags, although this is not
a requirement (using. e.g. `cset:tip` would work too). 
Finally, the branch: prefix has a special meaning, as this will not select
the specified revision, but the head which is reachable from that revision.


=== TracBrowser changes ===

The TracBrowser ''View revision'' form has been extended with
pulldown menus for jumping to a given tag or branch (in Mercurial, 
a branch within a repository corresponds to a head, i.e. a 
changeset without children): [[Image(hg-plugin-browser.png)]]


== Bugs and Limitations ==

There are still a lot of things that can be improved.

=== Features that Trac+svn has but not currently implemented for Trac+hg ===

 * History doesn't follow copy/move operations
 * No ''path history'' mode (i.e. show all create/delete operations that 
   affected a given path)

=== Multi-repository support ===

First and foremost, even if Mercurial allows intra-repository branching, 
it strongly supports the use of branching by cloning the full repository.
Therefore, it is common to have a lot of hg repositories around, each
devoted to the implementation of some particular feature.

Trac should support this by the way of multiple repository support 
within a single environment (see #2086).


=== Arbitrary diff support ===

The TracDiff features should be supported by TracMercurial too.


=== To cache or not to cache? ===

I happen to like to current database-free implementation of the Mercurial
support.
It makes it quite easy to change the `repository_dir` on the fly, and this 
flexibility is good. Also, hg being remarkably efficient, as everybody knows,
the performance is quite good... Except in one case, getting the history
of a directory. There, I suspect that the database cache would be quite useful.
But I have yet to try on a big repository (e.g. the kernel) with either
approach before concluding. In any case, thanks to the vc refactoring,
the possibility will be offered to choose between a direct access or a 
cached access, as it's done for Subversion, svn: (cached) or
direct-svn-fs: (direct access).

  ''cboos: I think I made up my mind, now that I tried to browse the kernel repo,
  it's way too slow without a db!
  Also, the way the diffs are produced currently (i.e. by Trac, from the full 
  content of the files) is also too slow to be usable on such big repositories 
  (e.g. the kernel changeset fc66195f585a took 7 minutes to be displayed on my 
  machine). We need to get the diffs directly from hg.''

=== Cool Features ===

''Wild ideas'' section...

==== Visualize branches and merges ====

There should be a way to show graphically the branch and merge points within
the revision log view. Not something as fancy as `hgk`, but nonetheless
something that will make the changeset relationships immediately obvious.

==== Search over the source ====

A search provider could do the equivalent of an `hg grep`.

==== Highlight Conflict Resolution ====

While visualizing changeset diffs for merge changesets, we already
show the changes relative to both parents, which helps to understand
how conflicts (if any) were solved. But this can be improved by 
specifically highlighting lines that differs from both parents.

==== ''Add your cool feature here...'' ====

----

== Implementation Notes ==

I'm interested in feedback concerning the code, in particular: 
 * concerning Trac, there are only a few changes to the standard modules,
   !ChangesetModule (the additional properties) and !BrowserModule
   (the tags and branches support). Those changes could possibly be promoted
   to the generic level, therefore removing the need for having to explicitely
   disable the SVN components...
 * concerning Mercurial, I'm pretty sure I did things in a sub-optimal
   way, as I was discovering the guts of hg while writing the plugin. 
   Therefore, I'll be pleased to get tips for improvements.
